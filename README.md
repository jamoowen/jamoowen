Welcome to my repository! ðŸ‘‹

My name is James, I'm passionate about building software to solve problems and automate things. I have a background and formal education in finance but taught myself how to code and entered tech after discovering how much I enjoy it. I have commercial experience working as a back end developer with big data, ETL processes and data modeling. I am also familiar with front end development and smart contract development through my own study and personal projects.

Pleae have a look at the projects I have created and do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to!
