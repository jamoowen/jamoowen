Welcome to my repository! ðŸ‘‹

My name is James, Im passionate about building software that solves problems. I have a background in finance but ever since discovering
my love for programming, I have been coding and developing new skills daily. I learned to code through brilliant online programmes such as
Harvard University's CS50 course on EdEx. Additionally, I have completed many other courses on Udemy, Coursera and LinkedinLearning. Being a largely self taught developer means that I'm a regular on StackOverflow and Google. I feel like this could be my greatest strength as a developer as it taught me how to learn on my own. Being adaptable and able to learn new languages and technologies is a critical skill in my opinion. 

Pleae have a look at the projects I have created and do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to!
