Greetings!

Welcome to my GitHub repository! üëã

I'm James, a full stack developer, passionate about Web3 and automation.

My professional journey has consisted mainly of backend development, where I've delved into significant data handling, ETL processes, and intricate data modeling. My experiences have not been confined to backend work alone and I am in the process of learning and creating frontend apps and Dapps. 

Have a look at some of my projects, and if you'd like to connect or learn more about my journey, feel free to reach out!
