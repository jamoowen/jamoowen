Welcome to my repository! ðŸ‘‹

My name is James, Im passionate about building software, finance, and solving problems. I have a background in finance but ever since discovering
my love for programming, I have been coding every day since. I learned to code primarily through excellent online programmes such as
Harvard University's CS50 course on EdEx. Additionally, I have completed many other courses on Udemy, Coursera and LinkedinLearning. 

Pleae have a look at the projects I have created and do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to!
